You can add it in the system settings, or refer to the official documentation:
- Add your css file to `/opt/seafile/seahub-data/custom/`;
- Overwrite `BRANDING_CSS` in `seahub_settings.py`
```
BRANDING_CSS = 'custom/custom.css'
```

At the same time, blue folder icons are provided, which need to be replaced `/home/seafile/seafile-pro-server-9.0.5/seahub/media/img/` manually
